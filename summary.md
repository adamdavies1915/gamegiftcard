# 🎮 GameGiftCard

A web tool that generates printable physical gift cards for digital game purchases, solving the awkward problem of giving someone a game code without anything to unwrap. Paste a game URL from Steam, Epic Games, or Xbox/Microsoft Store and the app fetches game artwork and details to create a beautiful, print-ready gift card with customizable "To" and "From" fields and a personal message. Built with Next.js and designed with a bold neobrutalist aesthetic, making digital gifts feel more personal and tangible.
